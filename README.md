# Edge and Corner detection from scratch
EE645 - 3D Computer Vision Assignment 1

The given two notebooks have the Canny edge detection and Harris corner algorithm implemented separately.
These image processing algorithms have been implemented from scratch
The steps to run the notebooks are:
1. Install numpy, opencv.
2. Change the path of the image to the one you want to process
3. Run the notebooks.
